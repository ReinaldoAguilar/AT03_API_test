----------------------------------- DIFFERENCES -------------------------------------
1.- When we use a class without apply the Singleton design pattern, every time an object is instantiated the values
of their instance variables are initialized again.
2.- An object instantiated in a class without Singleton pattern, always have a different object id.
3.- In a class that applies the Singleton design pattern, its initialize method is only called once.
