======================== Singleton ===================================
 1.- Should be better to use singleton for this implementation? Why?

 R.- For this exercise the best would be to use the Singleton pattern, since every time we need to use the values of
 the object (obtain the products of the store), we will only have to initialize once the instance, whereas if we would
 not use it we would have to call each Time we would like to see the products to the method of initialization of the
 object.
